# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Djibril Coulybaly

Student Number: C18423664

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
This assignment is based on creating a visual art piece that could repond to whatever music is playing or have it be inspired by a particular type of music.In other words, "Something beautiful to enjoy while listening to music". I chose to do a visual art piece which was inspired by a particular piece of music. The music I chose is called Sunday by GroovyRoom featuring Heize and Jay Park. This song is in Korean but is sung by both a Korean and Japanese artist. Even though my proficiency in Korean is not the best, the song is able to transcend the language barrier. This song empowers me to believe that no matter whats going on in your life, knowing who you are, what you stand for and believe in is what will get you through in life. Seeing the beauty in what you have and showing love for the people who encourage and support you. 

I've also been curious in learning about Asian Culture, in particular Korean and Japanese. Their way of life, food and their intricate attention to detail really resonates with me personally. I've chosen to create four visuals that I best believe conveys that message. 

The first visual is an introduction to the assignment. The Korean Flag is displayed in the centre of the page alongside the title of the assignment, my name and the song used for my visuals.

The second visual is a grid representation of the Korean and Japanese Flag. Seeing as the arists of this song are from these countries, i thought it would be cool to display the flags of both nations who share similar values, beliefs, customs and traditions.

The third visual is of a locus flower, which has the ability to rise from the dirty, murky waters to bloom into a beautiful pure flower. It's really symbolic of how we can rise above human suffering and prosper. That's one of the meaningful messages thats conveyed in the song.

The forth visual is of a red-crowned crane. They are respected and considered very pious, peaceful and loyal within the Asian community. They hold themselves with pride and dignity and can be a deadly force when there's strength in numbers

The last visual is of the Japanese Mountain - Mount Fiji. Like every mountain, it's unique, one-of-a-kind and an original copy - just like us humans!


# Instructions
To run the visuals, you need to un-comment the method calls to the visuals in main.java. Each visual is done in a seperate file with comments on each line of code for readability and understanding. On loading the visual, press the spacebar to begin playing the song associated with each visual.
# How it works
# References
For this assignment, I did use some websites as references to constructing my visuals. These are:
- https://forum.processing.org/one/topic/south-korea-flag.html
- https://youtu.be/AUddj9kzyyY

In all of my visuals, there's extensive commenting placed at each line of code explaining how and why it exixts 


# What I am most proud of in the assignment
In my opinion, what I am most proud of is the visual of the Japanese Mountain and the Korean/Japanese crane. Not only is it visually and aesthetically attractive, I've learned how to computationally think about how to create these visuals in terms of dynamically obtaining the measurements, utilizing the Processing References and textbooks, programming the code to be modular and reusable & implementing new concepts learned outside the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming Module. 

Using the referenced sources above for extra supplementation, I know and understand what each line of code does. A well rounded programmer knows how to implement code in various ways and doing this assignment has made me thing of better and efficient ways to implemnt code. I've also learned that I am a visual and kinetic learner, meaning that I learn, articulate retain more information better when I see and do. 

One thing however that I could improve on moving forward is learning how to hide/show items and display multiple sketches one by one on a timer basis rather than the method I used above. 


I also believe that the visual of the Japanese Mountain and the Korean/Japanese crane speak to me as an indivdual. It has made me realise that the cultural and physical characteristics of both these works of nature can be personified to me. I've always been a happy-go-lucky person who marches to the beat of my own drums. I am unique and determined to giving my all into anything that'll give me joy and fuffilment in life. Having done this assignment, it has made me reflect on my journey in life, how I've positioned myself to be where I am today and why I couldn't be any prouder of myself.
