# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Djibril Coulybaly

Student Number: C18423664

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
This assignment is based on creating a visual art piece that could repond to whatever music is playing or have it be inspired by a particular type of music.In other words, "Something beautiful to enjoy while listening to music". I chose to do a visual art piece which was inspired by a particular piece of music. The music I chose is called Sunday by GroovyRoom featuring Heize and Jay Park. This song is in Korean but is sung by both a Korean and Japanese artist. Even though my proficiency in Korean is not the best, the song is able to transcend the language barrier. This song empowers me to believe that no matter whats going on in your life, knowing who you are, what you stand for and believe in is what will get you through in life. Seeing the beauty in what you have and showing love for the people who encourage and support you. 

I've also been curious in learning about Asian Culture, in particular Korean and Japanese. Their way of life, food and their intricate attention to detail really resonates with me. I've chosen to create four visuals that I best believe conveys that message. 

# Instructions
To run the visuals, you need to un-comment the method calls to the visuals in main.java. Each visual is done in a seperate file with comments on each line of code for readability and understanding.
# How it works
# References
For this assignment, I did use some websites as references to contructing my visuals. These are:
- http://new.joyofprocessing.com/blog/2011/11/how-to-draw-the-south-korean-flag/
- https://youtu.be/AUddj9kzyyY

In all of my visuals, there's extensive commenting placed at each line of code explaining how and why it exixts 


# What I am most proud of in the assignment
In my opinion, what I am most proud of is the visual of the Japanese Mountain and the Korean/Japanese crane. Not only is it visually and aesthetically attractive, I've learned how to computationally think about how to make these visuals in terms of dynamically obtaining the measurements, making use of the Processing References and implementing new concepts learned outside the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming Module. I also beliebve that the Japanese Mountain and the Korean/Japanese crane
